# Euclidean-Distances

### Project Utilizes:
- Pandas
  - Series/Dataframes
  - Loaded Operators
  - Higher Order functions
- NumPy
  - linalg module
- SciPy 
  - distance module
- Timeit
  -  default_timer() method

### Project Features:
- Project delves into several different ways to compute the Euclidean distance between two points. 
- Euclidean distance measures are central to the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. 
- Different algorithms are timed to help determine which method of computing Euclidean distance is the most efficient.
- Algorithm iterations to visualize the impact on the algorithm's duration.
