# Euclidean Distances

#### Project is in the process of being uploaded completly, thank you for your patience! Exciting!!    

#### Euclidean distance measures are central to the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, thus this project utilizes  *5* algorithims to calculate Euclidean point value differences and each algorithim's detailed numerical complexity analysis!

### Project Utilizes:
- Pandas
  - Series/Dataframes
  - Loaded Operators
  - Higher Order functions
- NumPy
  - linalg module
- SciPy 
  - distance module
- Timeit
  -  default_timer() method

### Project Features:
- Project delves into several different ways to compute the Euclidean distance between two points. 
- Different algorithms are timed to help determine which method of computing Euclidean distance is the most efficient.
- Algorithm iterations to visualize the impact on the algorithm's duration.
